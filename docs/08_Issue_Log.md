## BUILD-001 — Vercel build failure after taxonomy cleanup

- **Status:** Implemented
- **Priority:** High
- **Root cause:** A full-file replacement of `lib/cms.ts` removed exports still used by article, RSS and sitemap routes: `articleDateLabel`, `getFeaturedImage`, `portableTextToSections`, `getPublishedArticles` and `getPublishedCategories`.
- **Fix:** Restored the missing helper exports and kept the International taxonomy fallback in `lib/cms.ts`.
- **Related commits:** `41ace4780c9210a87d4d87579202b918665ec241`.
- **Deployment status:** Pending redeploy.
- **Verification steps:** Confirm Vercel build succeeds; verify article pages, `/rss.xml`, and `/sitemap.xml` render.
- **Resolution date:** Pending

## TAX-001 — Europe to International taxonomy rename

- **Status:** Implemented
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Root cause:** The site navigation should use `International` rather than `Europe`, but Sanity may still contain legacy `Europe` records until the seed workflow is rerun.
- **Fix:** Header now links to `/categories/international`; `/categories/europe` redirects to `/categories/international`; `getCategoryPage` supports legacy `europe` records when the requested slug is `international`; seed script now writes International taxonomy records.
- **Related commits:** `85b4c50`, `037c18d`, `8a54aa4`, `dd2c886`, `a6e44eb`, `41ace478`.
- **Deployment status:** Pending successful production deploy.
- **Verification steps:** Verify `/categories/international` does not 404; verify `/categories/europe` redirects; run `Seed Sanity CMS` if legacy labels remain visible.
- **Resolution date:** Pending

## MEDIA-001 — Editorial Image Archive Studio

- **Status:** Pending Verification
- **Priority:** High
- **Root cause:** The project needs a structured media library so original Rugby Panda photos and approved external images can be reused safely and quickly.
- **Implementation:** `editorialImage` schema and Studio structure implemented, then improved with larger imported URL previews, review queues, rejected lifecycle status, optional multi-value photo types, event/album, venue and teams fields, and a bulk Image Review tool.
- **Public attribution rule:** Original images must be credited publicly as `Photo: The Rugby Panda` and `© The Rugby Panda`.
- **Related PRs:** #26 plus direct follow-up commits on main.
- **Deployment status:** Studio redeployed and used by the user.
- **Verification steps:** Confirm final counts in Needs Review, Approved, Rejected and Rugby Panda Originals.
- **Resolution date:** Pending

## MEDIA-002 — Starter editorial image library

- **Status:** Pending Verification
- **Priority:** High
- **Root cause:** The site needs a starter library of reusable images while original Rugby Panda photography grows.
- **Current state:** Apify → GitHub → Sanity import pipeline imported 16 `editorialImage` candidate records into the Sanity production dataset. The user reviewed images through the bulk Image Review workflow.
- **Target:** 100 approved starter images over time.
- **Deployment status:** Imported data exists; review workflow works.
- **Verification steps:** Confirm reviewed candidate counts in Studio.
- **Resolution date:** Pending

## MEDIA-003 — Rugby Panda original photo import

- **Status:** Pending Verification
- **Priority:** High
- **Root cause:** Original Rugby Panda photography should become the preferred source for article images and evergreen assets.
- **Current state:** Metadata manifest prepared and ZIP import workflow used to import 22 original Rugby Panda photos into Sanity as approved originals.
- **Attribution:** All originals must use `The Rugby Panda Original`, `Photo: The Rugby Panda`, `© The Rugby Panda`, `Approved`, and `usageApproved = true`.
- **Deployment status:** Import workflow completed successfully according to user confirmation.
- **Verification steps:** Confirm all 22 originals appear in the Rugby Panda Originals queue.
- **Resolution date:** Pending

## BRAND-001 — Brand Assets library

- **Status:** Open
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Root cause:** Team logos and competition branding should be handled separately from editorial photography because they have different rights/trademark considerations.
- **Target:** Separate Brand Assets library for team logos and competition logos, marked as editorial/trademark use only.
- **Deployment status:** Not implemented.
- **Verification steps:** Define schema, source rules and review workflow before importing logos.
- **Resolution date:** Pending

## CMS-002 — CMS article images missing

- **Status:** Open
- **Priority:** High
- **Root cause:** Current published articles do not consistently have featured image assets assigned from the new Editorial Images library.
- **Deployment status:** Not implemented
- **Verification steps:** Assign approved editorial images to current articles, then verify homepage cards and article pages render images.
- **Resolution date:** Pending

## WEB-005 — Search placeholder

- **Status:** Open
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Root cause:** Search UI exists but has not been implemented as a real searchable editorial experience.
- **Deployment status:** Not implemented
- **Verification steps:** Implement search, verify article/category/tag discovery in production.
- **Resolution date:** Pending
